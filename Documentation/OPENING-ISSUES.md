# How to open issues for waflyctl

Issues can be opened using github's tracker. You can see a explanation [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).
Issues are for tracking broken functionality and are intended for managing development work to address these.

If you have an issue with usage or need general assistance using this module,
or Fastly in general please use the [support information](../README.md#support).

This describes what content should be added to a issue to help with an
expedient resolution.

## What to post

A good bug report contains the data necessary to reproduce, identify, locate
and address a problem in code. Where possible it should also indicate what
steps have already been taken to address the issue and their result too.

A report should be reproducible on a base install of waflyctl.
